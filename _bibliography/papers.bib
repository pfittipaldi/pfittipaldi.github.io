abstract = { Satellite quantum communication is a promising way to build long distance quantum links, making it an essential complement to optical fiber for quantum internetworking beyond metropolitan scales. A satellite point to point optical link differs from the more common fiber links in many ways, both quantitative (higher latency, strong losses) and qualitative (nonconstant parameter values during satellite passage, intermittency of the link, impossibility to set repeaters between the satellite and the ground station). We study here the performance of a quantum link between two ground stations, using a quantum-memory-equipped satellite as a quantum repeater. In contrast with quantum key distribution satellite links, the number of available quantum memory slots m, together with the unavoidable round-trip communication latency t of at least a few milliseconds, severely reduces the effective average repetition rate to m/t-at most a few kilohertz for foreseeable quantum memories. Our study uses two approaches, which validate each other: 1) a simple analytical model of the effective rate of the quantum link; 2) an event-based simulation using the open source Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). The important differences between satellite and fiber links led us to modify QuISP itself. This work paves the way to the study of hybrid satellite-and fiber-based quantum repeater networks interconnecting different metropolitan areas. },

  abstract = {Quantum internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between arbitrary pairs of users. This article deals with the problem of scheduling in an arbitrary entanglement swapping quantum network—often called first-generation quantum network—in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware formulation. We introduce a linear algebraic framework that exploits quantum memory through the creation of intermediate entangled links. The framework is then employed to apply Lyapunov drift minimization (a standard technique in classical network science) to mathematically derive a natural class of scheduling policies for quantum networks minimizing the square norm of the user demand backlog. Moreover, an additional class of Max-Weight-inspired policies is proposed and benchmarked, reducing significantly the computation cost at the price of a slight performance degradation. The policies are compared in terms of information availability, localization, and overall network performance through an ad hoc simulator that admits user-provided network topologies and scheduling policies in order to showcase the potential application of the provided tools to quantum network design.},

  abstract={Future quantum internet aims to enable quantum communication between arbitrary pairs of distant nodes through the sharing of end-to-end entanglement, a universal resource for many quantum applications. As in classical networks, quantum networks also have to resolve problems related to routing and satisfaction of service at a sufficient rate. We deal here with the problem of scheduling when multiple commodities must be served through a quantum network based on first generation quantum repeaters, or quantum switches. To this end, we introduce a novel discrete-time algebraic model for arbitrary network topology, including transmission and memory losses, and adapted to dynamic scheduling decisions.Our algebraic model allows the scheduler to use the storage of temporary intermediate links to optimize the performance, depending on the information availability, ranging from full global information for a centralized scheduler to partial local information for a distributed one. As an illustrative example, we compare a simple greedy scheduling policy with several Max-Weight inspired scheduling policies and illustrate the resulting achievable rate regions for two competing pairs of clients through a network.},
